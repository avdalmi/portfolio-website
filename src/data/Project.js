            `As a project for a new start-up secondment company, together with another developer we built a CV- builder.My colleague and I split the responsibilities, where I was in charge of the front - end developement and he was in charge of the back - end developement. \n
            The front - end was built using React, Formik, Yup validations, Axios, and Material UI. The back - end utilises MongoDB, Overleaf to produce LaTeX
            files.\n The goal of this project was to provide a standardized CV format that the company could use to send to clients.By utilizing Formik and Yup
            validation, I was able to create a user - friendly form that ensured all necessary information was collected and entered correctly.Axios was used to grab and display country data from countryAPI.Material UI was used to create a visually appealing and intuitive user interface. \n
            With this CV - builder, the secondment company can now quickly and efficiently generate a standardized CV that accurately reflects the
            skills and qualifications of their employees.`,
